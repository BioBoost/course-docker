# Chapter 04 - Running Containers

Running images with Docker can be done using the `docker run` command. The command can take many attributes that supply information on how to run the container. It also allow you to override all defaults set by the image developer, as well as those set by the docker runtime.

To run the well-known `hello-world` image, we can use the following command.

```bash
docker run hello-world:latest
```

Here `hello-world` is the name of the image and `latest` is the version tag, which allows you to pick a specific version to run a container from.

This will pull the latest image from Docker Hub and spawn a container from it. The container will execute the binary which generates the output. This output is then redirected via the Docker client to your current terminal.
