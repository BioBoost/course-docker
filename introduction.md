# What is Docker?

![Docker logo](img/docker-logo.jpg)

Docker is a tool for running software in an isolated environment.

It offers advantages similar to running applications in virtual machines.

1. Same environment
2. Sandbox projects \(security and conflicting dependencies\)
3. It just works \(all dependencies are available inside the container\)

All advantages without a virtual machine



Using same kernel

special features of the Linux system to create isolated environment

containers are a compromise, separation and sandboxing is not strict, but its enough

containers start up in seconds. Use less resources, and less memory.
